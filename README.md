## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- To make border radius on images you need to set overflow hidden on the parent container
- Making the hover effect of the button required the use of z-index and box-shadow

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning about making different hover effects using box-shadow.

### Useful resources
